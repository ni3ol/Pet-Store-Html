<h2 id="borderimg1">Looking After A Dog</h2>


<h2 id="borderimg1">Every year your dog should:</h2>

<p>Visit the vet at least once for a check up to make sure your dog is fit and healthy.<br>

Once a year, have an injection (called a "vaccinnation") to protect your dog from nasty diseases that would make your dog very poorly or even die.  The vet will usually give your dog this injection at the same time as the check up.</br>

Have his teeth checked to ensure they are clean, strong and healthy.<br></p>

<h2 id="borderimg1">Every month your dog should:</h2>

<p>Be protected against fleas and worms.  The vet can give your dog a special treatment that will stop your dog from catching fleas and worms.  If your dog is not treated, the fleas can give your dog itchy skin and the worms can give your dog an upset tummy.<br></p>

<h2 id="borderimg1">Every week, your dog should:</h2>

<p>Have his coat brushed.  Some weeks your dog may need a bath so you may need a grown-up to help you with this. <br></p>

<h2 id="borderimg1">Every day, your dog should:</h2>

<p>Be fed healthy food.  The vet can tell you about the best food to feed your dog to help keep your dog fit and healthy and to keep your dog's teeth and coat in good condition.<br>

Have fresh water.</br>

Get plenty of exercise.  A good walk together will be good exercise for you too, as well as being fun!<br></br><br><i>(Adapted from http://www.petdoctors.co.uk/pet-advice/pet-care-for-kids/caring-for-your-dog/)</i>
